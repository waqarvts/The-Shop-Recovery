					<p><strong>Financial Disclosure</strong>
					Your physician has a financial interest in The Recovery Shop. You have the right to purchase from The Recovery Shop or any vendor you would like. The products recommended to you have be reviewed and are supported for use by your physician.</p>
					<br>					
					<p><strong>NOTICE TO PATIENTS</strong>
					Because of concerns that there may be a conflict of interest when a physician refers a patient to a health care facility in which the physician has a financial interest, New York State passed a law. The law prohibits me, with certain exceptions, from referring you for certain services to a facility in which I or any of my immediate family members have a financial interest. If certain exceptions in the law apply, or if I am referring you for other than for those services, I can make the referral under one condition. The condition is that I disclose this financial interest and tell you about alternative providers where you may go to obtain these services. This disclosure is intended to help you make a fully informed decision about your health care. I or my immediate family members have a financial relationship with the following providers</p>
					<br>					
					<p><strong>The Recovery Shop</strong>
					The Joint Effort Administrative Services Organization,<br>
					For more information about alternative providers, please ask me or my staff. We will provide you with names and addresses of providers best suited to your individual needs that are nearest to your home or place of work.</p>
